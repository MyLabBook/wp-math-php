#WordPress Plugin for the MathPHP Library

This WordPress plugin encapsulates the library found at https://github.com/markrogoyski/math-php. The initial goal is to expose the statistical functions for data analysis. Later development will include more functionality from the MathPHP library.

This builds on the code presented in the YouTube WP Plugin tutorials by Alessandro (aka Alecad)
